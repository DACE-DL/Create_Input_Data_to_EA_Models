# Create Input Files to the Entity Alignment Models from TTL/XML/NT Source and Target KGs
Create proper input files to the entity alignment models using reference alignment file and the turtle/XML/NTriple files of source and target knowledge graphs.
Please note that the inputs have been made so the EA models can be run on a variety of datasets without causing runtime errors.

Any contributions to providing codes to generate proper inputs for the other entity alignment models are highly welcomed!
