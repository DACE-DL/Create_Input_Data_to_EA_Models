Add your source, target and reference alignment ttl/xml/nt files here (As an example, I uploaded the Doremus dataset files).
I clarify that the "char_vocab" file is copied from the i-Align to this directory because we need to update this vocabulary if we encounter any new characters in our datasets. (Link to the i-Align model: https://bitbucket.org/bayudt/i-align/src/master/)
