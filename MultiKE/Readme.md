This gives you the proper input files to the MultiKE entity alignment model having the xml/ttl/nt files of source and target KGs together with their reference alignment file.
(Link to the MultiKE model: https://github.com/nju-websoft/MultiKE)

1. Please put the source KG, target KG, and reference alignment files in the "raw_files" folder. Then,
2. Please fill out the necessary parameters in the Param.py file. Then,
3. Please run the run.sh file (you can run it in the command window using: bash run.sh)

The proper input to the MultiKE model would be available in 'multike_inputs' folder after running the codes.
